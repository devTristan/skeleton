# Your Package

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/devTristan/skeleton.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

I can't even begin to explain how tired I am of reproducing this setup

## Sensible defaults for es6 development

Everything is already configured for immediate development.

 * javascript standard style
 * babel transpilation
 * npm scripts: `build`, `watch`, `test`, `lint`, `clean`
 * git pre-commit hook for testing and linting
 * prepublish script for testing and linting
 * sensible .gitignore and .npmignore
 * test that will fail if your `dist` is out of date
 * a README.md with lots of bullet points

## Example

```console
cp -r skeleton newProject
cd newProject
# do stuff
```

## Install

```console
npm install yourpackage
```
